# SAASG

A Multi-Source Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping framework for large-scale crop mapping with spatial transfer.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides the implementation of a **multi-source phenology-based crop mapping framework**, including:

* Standard Multi-Phase Feature Curve (S-MPFC) construction
* Multi-Source Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (MS-TWDTW)
* Grid-based spatial transfer with iterative sample generation

The framework integrates **Sentinel-1 SAR + Sentinel-2 optical features (NDVI, CNDVI)** to improve crop discrimination under spatial heterogeneity.
