# SAASG

A Multi-Source Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping framework for large-scale crop mapping with spatial transfer.

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides the implementation of a **multi-source phenology-based crop mapping framework**, including:

* Standard Multi-Phase Feature Curve (S-MPFC) construction
* Multi-Source Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (MS-TWDTW)
* Grid-based spatial transfer with iterative sample generation

The framework integrates **Sentinel-1 SAR + Sentinel-2 optical features (NDVI, CNDVI)** to improve crop discrimination under spatial heterogeneity.

## ⚙️ Requirements

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main dependencies:

* earthengine-api
* geemap

ee.Initialize()
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1️⃣ Build Standard Phenological Curve

```bash
python python/01_build_smpfc.py
```

Output:

```
results/mean_curve.npy
results/time.npy
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run MS-TWDTW

```bash
python python/02_ms_twdtw.py
```

---

### 3️⃣ Grid-based Spatial Transfer

```bash
python python/03_grid_transfer.py
```

## 📊 Features Used

| Feature | Description                  |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| SAR     | VV + VH                      |
| NDVI    | (B8 - B4) / (B8 + B4)        |
| CNDVI   | NDVI with texture constraint |

---

## 🧠 Method Highlights

* Multi-phase feature fusion (SAR → NDVI → CNDVI)
